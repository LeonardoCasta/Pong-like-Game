# INTRODUCTION
Hi I'm an Italian SW developer and i started to work on this small project coz i wanted to learn C++ and SFML, this is the first thing i created.
It is full of bugs and the code is a mess but i really enjoyed doing it.

Game was made on Arch Linux and works only on linux

Before playing you need to install SFML into your PC, SFML do not support static linking on Linux :(

# EXECUTION COMMAND
Inside the folder execute:
```bash
make -C ./build 

./game 
```
